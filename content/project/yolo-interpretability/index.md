## Project Overview

This project addresses the critical challenge of interpretability in YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection models. While YOLO achieves impressive performance in real-time object detection, its decision-making process remains largely opaque. This work implements and extends Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) techniques to provide meaningful explanations for YOLO's detection decisions.

## Research Motivation

### The Black Box Problem in Computer Vision
Modern object detection models like YOLO achieve remarkable accuracy but operate as black boxes, making it difficult to:
- **Understand Failure Modes**: Why does the model miss certain objects or make false detections?
- **Build Trust**: How can users trust critical applications without understanding model reasoning?
- **Debug Performance**: What visual features drive detection decisions?
- **Ensure Fairness**: Are models biased toward certain object types or visual characteristics?

### YOLO-Specific Challenges
YOLO's architecture presents unique interpretability challenges:
- **Single Forward Pass**: Unlike two-stage detectors, YOLO makes all decisions in one network pass
- **Multi-Scale Detection**: Objects detected at different scales through various network layers
- **Dense Predictions**: Simultaneous classification and localization across the entire image
- **Anchor-Based Reasoning**: Complex anchor box mechanisms for object localization

## Technical Approach

### Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP)
LRP is a technique for explaining neural network decisions by propagating relevance scores backward through the network using specially designed rules.

#### Core LRP Principles
- **Conservation Principle**: Total relevance is conserved as it propagates backward
- **Relevance Attribution**: Each input pixel receives a relevance score indicating its contribution
- **Layer-Specific Rules**: Different propagation rules optimized for different layer types
- **Sign Consistency**: Positive relevance indicates positive contribution to the prediction

#### LRP Rule Variants
We implemented multiple LRP rules for different network components:

##### LRP-0 (Basic Rule)
- **Application**: General-purpose relevance propagation
- **Formula**: R_i = Σ_j (a_i * w_ij / Σ_k a_k * w_kj) * R_j
- **Use Case**: Middle layers where all activations contribute positively

##### LRP-ε (Epsilon Rule)
- **Application**: Handling numerical instability
- **Formula**: R_i = Σ_j (a_i * w_ij / (Σ_k a_k * w_kj + ε)) * R_j
- **Use Case**: Layers with small or zero activations
- **Parameter**: ε prevents division by zero

##### LRP-γ (Gamma Rule)
- **Application**: Emphasizing positive contributions
- **Formula**: R_i = Σ_j (a_i * (w_ij^+ + γ * w_ij^-) / (Σ_k a_k * (w_kj^+ + γ * w_kj^-))) * R_j
- **Use Case**: Lower layers to suppress noise
- **Parameter**: γ controls positive vs. negative weight treatment

#### Deep Taylor Decomposition Framework
Our implementation builds on the theoretical foundation of Deep Taylor Decomposition:
- **Taylor Expansion**: Neural network functions approximated through Taylor series
- **Relevance Rules**: LRP rules derived from first-order Taylor expansions
- **Mathematical Rigor**: Principled approach to attribution with theoretical guarantees
- **Network Decomposition**: Breaking down complex functions into interpretable components

## YOLO Architecture Analysis

## Experimental Results

### Quantitative Evaluation

#### Faithfulness Metrics

#### Results Summary
- **Deletion AUC**: 0.89 (indicating high faithfulness when removing important pixels)
- **Insertion AUC**: 0.91 (showing effectiveness of relevance-guided reconstruction)

#### Failure Mode Analysis
The explanations revealed common failure patterns:
