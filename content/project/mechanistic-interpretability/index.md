## Project Overview

This project explores the mechanistic interpretability of GPT-2, focusing on understanding how positional information is encoded and processed within the transformer architecture. Inspired by Chris Olah's work at Anthropic and building upon Neel Nanda's foundational research, this investigation provides insights into the internal mechanisms of large language models.

## Research Motivation

### The Black Box Problem
Modern large language models achieve impressive performance across diverse tasks, but their internal mechanisms remain largely opaque. Understanding how these models process and represent information is crucial for:
- **Safety and Alignment**: Ensuring AI systems behave as intended
- **Debugging and Improvement**: Identifying failure modes and optimization opportunities
- **Scientific Understanding**: Advancing our knowledge of artificial intelligence
- **Trust and Transparency**: Building confidence in AI-powered systems

### Positional Encoding Focus
Positional information is fundamental to language understanding, yet how transformers learn and utilize position remains poorly understood. This research investigates:
- How positional embeddings evolve through the network layers
- Which attention heads are crucial for position processing
- How positional information interacts with semantic content
- The emergence of position-related circuits in trained models

## Technical Approach

### TransformerLens Framework
We utilized TransformerLens, developed by Neel Nanda, which provides:
- **Direct Access**: Clean interfaces to internal model states
- **Activation Patching**: Techniques for causal intervention analysis
- **Visualization Tools**: Comprehensive plotting and analysis utilities
- **Research Reproducibility**: Standardized methods for interpretability research

### Experimental Design

#### Data Generation Pipeline
- **Synthetic Datasets**: Generated controlled sequences for position analysis
- **Natural Language Corpora**: Evaluated on real-world text distributions
- **Position-Specific Tasks**: Designed tasks that isolate positional reasoning
- **Ablation Studies**: Systematic removal of components to test causal relationships

#### Probing Classifier Development
We implemented multiple probing approaches:
- **Logistic Regression**: Linear probes for position prediction from residual streams
- **Neural Network Probes**: Non-linear classifiers for complex position patterns
- **Layer-wise Analysis**: Tracking positional information across transformer layers
- **Attention Head Ablation**: Individual attention head importance analysis

## Key Findings

### Positional Information Flow
Our analysis revealed several important patterns:

#### Layer-wise Evolution
- **Early Layers**: Raw positional embeddings dominate representation
- **Middle Layers**: Gradual integration of position with semantic content
- **Late Layers**: Position information becomes highly processed and task-specific
- **Residual Connections**: Critical pathways for preserving positional information

#### Attention Head Specialization
We identified specific attention heads with distinct positional functions:
- **Position Heads**: Heads that primarily attend based on relative position
- **Content Heads**: Heads that focus on semantic content regardless of position
- **Hybrid Heads**: Heads that integrate both positional and semantic information
- **Copying Heads**: Heads that implement position-sensitive copying mechanisms

### Predictive Capabilities
Our probing classifiers demonstrated:
- **High Accuracy**: >95% accuracy in predicting token positions from residual streams
- **Robust Performance**: Consistent results across different text domains
- **Layer Sensitivity**: Optimal probing performance at intermediate layers
- **Generalization**: Models trained on one domain transfer to others

### Circuit Discovery
We identified key computational circuits:

#### Position Processing Circuit
