        I live in the messy, beautiful space where theoretical research meets production realityâ€”where your elegant algorithm suddenly needs to process billion-node security graphs at 3 AM without melting the datacenter. As an ML engineer at Microsoft Security Research, I spend my days wrangling everything from custom CUDA kernels to 13B-parameter language models, turning "this works in my notebook" into "this protects millions of users."

        This website documents my adventures in applied chaos: building bare-metal ML operating systems in Zig, convincing graph neural networks to detect threats in real-time, and occasionally discovering that the best way to explain a YOLO model is through layer-wise relevance propagation. The views here are my own caffeine-fueled thoughts, not Microsoft's.
