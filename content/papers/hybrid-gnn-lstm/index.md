## Abstract

In modern enterprise environments, security teams face the challenge of detecting sophisticated attacks that evolve over time and exploit complex relationships between network entities. Traditional anomaly detection methods often fail to capture both the structural dependencies in security graphs and the temporal patterns of attack sequences. This work addresses these limitations by proposing a novel hybrid architecture that combines the spatial reasoning capabilities of Graph Neural Networks with the temporal modeling strength of LSTM networks.

## Introduction

### Problem Statement
Enterprise security graphs contain billions of nodes representing users, devices, processes, and network connections. Detecting anomalous behavior requires understanding:
- **Spatial Relationships**: How entities are connected and influence each other
- **Temporal Patterns**: How behavior evolves over time
- **Multi-scale Dependencies**: Local anomalies that may be part of larger attack campaigns

### Current Limitations
Existing approaches suffer from several key limitations:
- **Static Analysis**: Graph-based methods that ignore temporal evolution
- **Temporal Myopia**: Time-series methods that miss structural context
- **Scalability Issues**: Inability to process enterprise-scale data in real-time
- **High False Positive Rates**: Lack of contextual understanding leading to alert fatigue

## Methodology

### Hybrid Architecture Design

#### Graph Neural Network Component
Our GNN component processes spatial relationships using:
- **Graph Attention Networks (GAT)**: Adaptive attention mechanisms for entity importance
- **Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN)**: Multi-hop neighbor aggregation
- **Heterogeneous Graph Handling**: Support for multiple entity and edge types
- **Scalable Sampling**: GraphSAINT sampling for large graph processing

#### LSTM Component
The temporal component employs:
- **Bidirectional LSTM**: Forward and backward temporal context
- **Attention Mechanism**: Focus on relevant time periods for anomaly detection
- **Multi-scale Temporal Windows**: Capture both short-term and long-term patterns
- **Gradient Flow Optimization**: Techniques to prevent vanishing gradients

#### Fusion Architecture
We introduce novel fusion mechanisms:
- **Cross-Attention**: Graph and temporal representations attend to each other
- **Multi-level Fusion**: Feature fusion at multiple architectural levels
- **Adaptive Weighting**: Dynamic balance between spatial and temporal contributions
- **Joint Training**: End-to-end optimization of the complete hybrid system

### Sliding-Window Approach

#### Window Design
- **Fixed Window Size**: Configurable temporal window for LSTM processing
- **Overlap Strategy**: Sliding windows with temporal overlap for continuity
- **Multi-resolution**: Different window sizes for different temporal scales
- **Adaptive Sizing**: Dynamic window adjustment based on event density

#### Real-time Processing
- **Stream Processing**: Online anomaly detection for live security events
- **Incremental Updates**: Efficient graph updates for streaming data
